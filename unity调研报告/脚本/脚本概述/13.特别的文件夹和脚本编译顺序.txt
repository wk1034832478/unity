Unity reserves some project folder names to indicate that the contents have a special purpose. Some of these folders have an effect on the order of script compilation. These folder names are:

Assets
Editor
Editor default resources
Gizmos
Plugins
Resources
Standard Assets
StreamingAssets

There are four separate phases of script compilation. The phase where a script is compiled is determined by its parent folder.

This is significant in cases where a script must refer to classes defined in other scripts
. The basic rule is that anything that is compiled in a phase after the current one cannot be referenced. Anything that is compiled in the current phase or an earlier phase is fully available.

The phases of compilation are as follows:

Phase 1: Runtime scripts in folders called Standard Assets
, Pro Standard Assets and Plugins
.
Phase 2: Editor scripts in folders called Editor that are anywhere inside top-level folders called Standard Assets, Pro Standard Assets and Plugins.
Phase 3: All other scripts that are not inside a folder called Editor.
Phase 4: All remaining scripts (those that are inside a folder called Editor).
Note: Standard Assets work only in the Assets
 root folder.
