每个lightmap
包含一些图表。在运行时，Unity将这些图表映射到网格上
，并使用图表的照明数据来计算最终的外观。由于GPU抽样的工作方式，
如果一个图表的数据彼此太接近，就会从另一个图表中流出。
这通常会导致意外的混叠、像素化和其他图形结果(这些被称为工件)。

识别重叠
1. 如果出现重叠现象，会从控制台打印出来相关信息
2. 在scene view中使用 UV Overlap模式，红色高亮的部分是重叠的部分
3. 使用Lighting中的Object Maps

Solutions
There is no one single solution for UV overlap, because there are so many things that can cause it. Here are the most common solutions to consider:
If Unity is automatically creating the lightmap UVs, you can increase the Pack Margin. To do this, navigate to the Model tab of the Mesh’s import settings.
Make sure Generate Lightmap UVs is enabled, then fold out Advanced and use the Pack Margin slider to increase the value. This creates more spacing between charts,
which reduces likelihood of overlap. However, this also increase the total space requirement for the lightmap, so try to apply enough spacing to avoid artifacts,
but no more. For more information on lightmap UVs that Unity creates automatically, see documentation on Generating lightmapping UVs.
If you provide lightmap UVs yourself, you can try adding margins using your modelling package.
Increase the resolution of the entire lightmap. This will increase the numbers of pixels between the charts, and therefore reduce the likelihood of bleeding.
The downside is that your lightmap may become too large. You can do this in the Lighting tab under Lightmapper Settings.
Increase the resolution of a single GameObject. This allows you to increase lightmap resolution only for GameObjects that have overlapping UVs.
Though less likely, this can also increase your lightmap size. You can change a GameObject’s lightmap resolution inside its Mesh Renderer
 under Lightmap Settings.
