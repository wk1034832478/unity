The AudioSettings class contains various bits of global information 
relating to the sound system, but most importantly it contains API that allows 
resetting the audio system at runtime in order to change settings such as 
speaker mode, sample rate (if supported by the platform), DSP buffer size and 
real/virtual voice counts.

Many of these settings can also be configured in the Audio section of the 
project settings . When changed these settings will apply both to the editor and 
define the initial state of the game while changes performed using the 
AudioSettings API only apply to the runtime of the game and are reset back to 
the state defined in the project settings when stopping the game in the editor.
